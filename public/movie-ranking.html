<p>1. Some people have a feeling of something missing in their heart. I do. We have something that we want, something that we need. Even if we feel that feeling, we should keep searching, or better keep exploring the world. Maybe what we are missing is something that we haven't found yet. That applies to people too of course. Why do we feel sometimes empty, even though we have people around us who love us? Because we want and need the one person who will be with us forever.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes it's alright to let go. If you want something very much, sometimes you have to take a break. It is better if you let go and hold at the same time. It is like catching a fish. You should let go a little if you feel like you are pulling too hard, but at the same time you don't let go completely. You wait patiently for the right chance. If you pull too hard, the fish may escape and you definitely don't want that. So patience andia the key to a lot of things.</p>

<p>3. In our lives there are a lot of unexpected events. When Taki and Mitsuha forgot their names, many thought how unlucky they were. And they indeed were unlucky. But things turned out to be better. And they had a happy ending. So no matter what happens, don't get discouraged, stay strong and wait. Good things are going to happen too and you won't even know how that happened</p>
